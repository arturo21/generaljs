# Quick setup

## HTML

Plyr extends upon the standard [HTML5 media element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) markup so that's all you need for those types.

### HTML5 Video

```html
<video poster="/path/to/poster.jpg" id="player" playsinline controls>
    <source src="/path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <source src="/path/to/video.webm" type="video/webm" />

    <!-- Captions are optional -->
    <track kind="captions" label="English captions" src="/path/to/captions.vtt" srclang="en" default />
</video>
```

### HTML5 Audio

```html
<audio id="player" controls>
    <source src="/path/to/audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
    <source src="/path/to/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
```

For YouTube and Vimeo players, Plyr uses progressive enhancement to enhance the default `<iframe>` embeds. Below are some examples. The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the embed responsive. You can add the `autoplay`, `loop`, `hl` (YouTube only) and `playsinline` (YouTube only) query parameters to the URL and they will be set as config options automatically. For YouTube, the `origin` should be updated to reflect the domain you're hosting the embed on, or you can opt to omit it.

### YouTube

We recommend [progressive enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) with the embedded players. You can elect to use an `<iframe>` as the source element (which Plyr will progressively enhance) or a bog standard `<div>` with two essential data attributes - `data-plyr-provider` and `data-plyr-embed-id`.

```html
<div class="plyr__video-embed" id="player">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTqVqk7FSmY?origin=https://plyr.io&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1"
        allowfullscreen
        allowtransparency
        allow="autoplay"
    ></iframe>
</div>
```

_Note_: The `plyr__video-embed` classname will make the player a responsive 16:9 (most common) iframe embed. When plyr itself kicks in, your custom `ratio` config option will be used.

Or the `<div>` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
<div id="player" data-plyr-provider="youtube" data-plyr-embed-id="bTqVqk7FSmY"></div>
```

_Note_: The `data-plyr-embed-id` can either be the video ID or URL for the media.

### Vimeo

Much the same as YouTube above.

```html
<div class="plyr__video-embed" id="player">
    <iframe
        src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?loop=false&amp;byline=false&amp;portrait=false&amp;title=false&amp;speed=true&amp;transparent=0&amp;gesture=media"
        allowfullscreen
        allowtransparency
        allow="autoplay"
    ></iframe>
</div>
```

Or the `<div>` non progressively enhanced method:

```html
<div id="player" data-plyr-provider="vimeo" data-plyr-embed-id="76979871"></div>
```

## JavaScript

You can use Plyr as an ES6 module as follows:

```javascript
import Plyr from 'plyr';

const player = new Plyr('#player');
```

Alertnatively you can include the `plyr.js` script before the closing `</body>` tag and then in your JS create a new instance of Plyr as below.

```html
<script src="path/to/plyr.js"></script>
<script>
    const player = new Plyr('#player');
</script>
```

See [initialising](#initialising) for more information on advanced setups.

You can use our CDN (provided by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)) for the JavaScript. There's 2 versions; one with and one without [polyfills](#polyfills). My recommendation would be to manage polyfills seperately as part of your application but to make life easier you can use the polyfilled build.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.plyr.io/3.5.6/plyr.js"></script>
```

...or...

```html
<script src="https://cdn.plyr.io/3.5.6/plyr.polyfilled.js"></script>
```

## CSS

Include the `plyr.css` stylsheet into your `<head>`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/plyr.css" />
```

If you want to use our CDN (provided by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)) for the default CSS, you can use the following:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.plyr.io/3.5.6/plyr.css" />
```

## SVG Sprite

The SVG sprite is loaded automatically from our CDN (provided by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)). To change this, see the [options](#options) below. For
reference, the CDN hosted SVG sprite can be found at `https://cdn.plyr.io/3.5.6/plyr.svg`.

# Ads

Plyr has partnered up with [vi.ai](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio) to offer monetization options for your videos. Getting setup is easy:

-   [Sign up for a vi.ai account](https://vi.ai/publisher-video-monetization/?aid=plyrio)
-   Grab your publisher ID from the code snippet
-   Enable ads in the [config options](#options) and enter your publisher ID

Any questions regarding the ads can be sent straight to vi.ai and any issues with rendering raised through GitHub issues.

# Advanced

## SASS

You can use `bundle.scss` file included in `/src` as part of your build and change variables to suit your design. The SASS require you to
use the [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) plugin (you should be already!) as all declarations use the W3C definitions.

The HTML markup uses the BEM methodology with `plyr` as the block, e.g. `.plyr__controls`. You can change the class hooks in the options to match any custom CSS
you write. Check out the JavaScript source for more on this.

## SVG

The icons used in the Plyr controls are loaded in an SVG sprite. The sprite is automatically loaded from our CDN by default. If you already have an icon build
system in place, you can include the source plyr icons (see `/src/sprite` for source icons).

### Using the `iconUrl` option

You can however specify your own `iconUrl` option and Plyr will determine if the url is absolute and requires loading by AJAX/CORS due to current browser
limitations or if it's a relative path, just use the path directly.

If you're using the `<base>` tag on your site, you may need to use something like this: [svgfixer.js](https://gist.github.com/leonderijke/c5cf7c5b2e424c0061d2)

More info on SVG sprites here: [http://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/](http://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/) and the AJAX
technique here: [http://css-tricks.com/ajaxing-svg-sprite/](http://css-tricks.com/ajaxing-svg-sprite/)

## Cross Origin (CORS)

You'll notice the `crossorigin` attribute on the example `<video>` elements. This is because the TextTrack captions are loaded from another domain. If your
TextTrack captions are also hosted on another domain, you will need to add this attribute and make sure your host has the correct headers setup. For more info
on CORS checkout the MDN docs:
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)

## Captions

WebVTT captions are supported. To add a caption track, check the HTML example above and look for the `<track>` element. Be sure to
[validate your caption files](https://quuz.org/webvtt/).

## JavaScript

### Initialising

You can specify a range of arguments for the constructor to use:

-   A [CSS string selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
-   A [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)
-   A [jQuery](https://jquery.com) object

_Note_: If a `NodeList`, `Array`, or jQuery object are passed, the first element will be used for setup. To setup multiple players, see [multiple players](#multiple-players) below.

#### Single player

Passing a CSS string selector that's compatible with [`querySelector`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector):

```javascript
const player = new Plyr('#player');
```

Passing a [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```javascript
const player = new Plyr(document.getElementById('player'));
```

```javascript
const player = new Plyr(document.querySelector('.js-player'));
```

The HTMLElement or string selector can be the target `<video>`, `<audio>`, or `<div>` wrapper for embeds.

#### Multiple players

You have two choices here. You can either use a simple array loop to map the constructor:

```javascript
const players = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.js-player')).map(p => new Plyr(p));
```

...or use a static method where you can pass a [CSS string selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), a [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList), an [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement), or a [JQuery](https://jquery.com) object:

```javascript
const players = Plyr.setup('.js-player');
```

Both options will also return an array of instances in the order of they were in the DOM for the string selector or the source NodeList or Array.

#### Options

The second argument for the constructor is the [options](#options) object:

```javascript
const player = new Plyr('#player', {
    title: 'Example Title',
});
```

Options can be passed as an object to the constructor as above or as JSON in `data-plyr-config` attribute on each of your target elements:

```html
<video src="/path/to/video.mp4" id="player" controls data-plyr-config='{ "title": "Example Title" }'></video>
```

Note the single quotes encapsulating the JSON and double quotes on the object keys. Only string values need double quotes.

});
```

You can also access the object through any events:

```javascript

| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`         | String | Either `video` or `audio`. _Note:_ YouTube and Vimeo are currently not supported as audio sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `title`        | String | _Optional._ Title of the new media. Used for the `aria-label` attribute on the play button, and outer container. YouTube and Vimeo are populated automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `sources`      | Array  | This is an array of sources. For HTML5 media, the properties of this object are mapped directly to HTML attributes so more can be added to the object if required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `tracks`&sup1; | String | An array of track objects. Each element in the array is mapped directly to a track element and any keys mapped directly to HTML attributes so as in the example above, it will render as `<track kind="captions" label="English" srclang="en" src="https://cdn.selz.com/plyr/1.0/example_captions_en.vtt" default>` and similar for the French version. Booleans are converted to HTML5 value-less attributes. |

1.  HTML5 only

# Events

You can listen for events on the target element you setup Plyr on (see example under the table). Some events only apply to HTML5 audio and video. Using your
reference to the instance, you can use the `on()` API method or `addEventListener()`. Access to the API can be obtained this way through the `event.detail.plyr`
property. Here's an example:

```javascript
player.on('ready', event => {
    const instance = event.detail.plyr;
});
```

## Standard Media Events

| `canplaythrough` | Sent when the ready state changes to `CAN_PLAY_THROUGH`, indicating that the entire media can be played without interruption, assuming the download rate remains at least at the current level. _Note:_ Manually setting the `currentTime` will eventually fire a `canplaythrough` event in firefox. Other browsers might not fire this event. |

| Event Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `statechange` | The state of the player has changed. The code can be accessed via `event.detail.code`. Possible values are `-1`: Unstarted, `0`: Ended, `1`: Playing, `2`: Paused, `3`: Buffering, `5`: Video cued. See the [YouTube Docs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#onStateChange) for more information. |

_Note:_ These events also bubble up the DOM. The event target will be the container element.

Some event details borrowed from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events).

# Embeds

YouTube and Vimeo are currently supported and function much like a HTML5 video. Similar events and API methods are available for all types. However if you wish
to access the API's directly. You can do so via the `embed` property of your player object - e.g. `player.embed`. You can then use the relevant methods from the
third party APIs. More info on the respective API's here:

-   [YouTube iframe API Reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference)
-   [Vimeo player.js Reference](https://github.com/vimeo/player.js)

_Note_: Not all API methods may work 100%. Your mileage may vary. It's better to use the Plyr API where possible.

# Shortcuts

By default, a player will bind the following keyboard shortcuts when it has focus. If you have the `global` option to `true` and there's only one player in the
document then the shortcuts will work when any element has focus, apart from an element that requires input.

| Key        | Action                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `0` to `9` | Seek from 0 to 90% respectively        |
| `space`    | Toggle playback                        |
| `K`        | Toggle playback                        |
| &larr;     | Seek backward by the `seekTime` option |
| &rarr;     | Seek forward by the `seekTime` option  |
| &uarr;     | Increase volume                        |
| &darr;     | Decrease volume                        |
| `M`        | Toggle mute                            |
| `F`        | Toggle fullscreen                      |
| `C`        | Toggle captions                        |
| `L`        | Toggle loop                            |

# Preview thumbnails

It's possible to display preview thumbnails as per the demo when you hover over the scrubber or while you are scrubbing in the main video area. This can be used for all video types but is easiest with HTML5 of course. You will need to generate the sprite or images yourself. This is possible using something like AWS transcoder to generate the frames and then combine them into a sprite image. Sprites are recommended for performance reasons - they will be much faster to download and easier to compress into a small file size making them load faster.

You can see the example VTT files [here](https://cdn.plyr.io/static/demo/thumbs/100p.vtt) and [here](https://cdn.plyr.io/static/demo/thumbs/240p.vtt) for how the sprites are done. The coordinates are set as the `xywh` hash on the URL in the order X Offset, Y Offset, Width, Height (e.g. `240p-00001.jpg#xywh=1708,480,427,240` is offset `1708px` from the left, `480px` from the top and is `427x240px`. If you want to include images per frame, this is also possible but will be slower, resulting in a degraded experience.

# Fullscreen

Fullscreen in Plyr is supported by all browsers that [currently support it](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen).

# Browser support

Plyr supports the last 2 versions of most _modern_ browsers.

| Browser       | Supported     |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Safari        | ‚úì             |
| Mobile Safari | ‚úì&sup1;       |
| Firefox       | ‚úì             |
| Chrome        | ‚úì             |
| Opera         | ‚úì             |
| Edge          | ‚úì             |
| IE11          | ‚úì&sup3;       |
| IE10          | ‚úì&sup2;&sup3; |

1.  Mobile Safari on the iPhone forces the native player for `<video>` unless the `playsinline` attribute is present. Volume controls are also disabled as they are handled device wide.
2.  Native player used (no support for `<progress>` or `<input type="range">`) but the API is supported. No native fullscreen support, fallback can be used (see [options](#options)).
3.  Polyfills required. See below.

## Polyfills

Plyr uses ES6 which isn't supported in all browsers quite yet. This means some features will need to be polyfilled to be available otherwise you'll run into issues. We've elected to not burden the ~90% of users that do support these features with extra JS and instead leave polyfilling to you to work out based on your needs. The easiest method I've found is to use [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) which provides polyfills based on user agent. This is the method the demo uses.

## Checking for support

You can use the static method to check for support. For example

```javascript
const supported = Plyr.supported('video', 'html5', true);
```

The arguments are:

-   Media type (`audio` or `video`)
-   Provider (`html5`, `youtube` or `vimeo`)
-   Whether the player has the `playsinline` attribute (only applicable to iOS 10+)

## Disable support programmatically

The `enabled` option can be used to disable certain User Agents. For example, if you don't want to use Plyr for smartphones, you could use:

```javascript
{
    enabled: /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
}
```

If a User Agent is disabled but supports `<video>` and `<audio>` natively, it will use the native player.
